## Banking System Test
The code repository aims to design a Web API solution towards Banking System Test with following design guidelines:
System allows for users and user accounts.

A user can have as many accounts as they want.
 
A user can create and delete accounts.
 
A user can deposit and withdraw from accounts.
 
An account cannot have less than $100 at any time in an account.
 
A user cannot withdraw more than 90% of their total balance from an
account in a single transaction.
 
A user cannot deposit more than $10,000 in a single transaction.
 
 
*Notes:*
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
There is no need to develop a GUI, please provide a Web API instead.  We will focus our review on coding style, organization, testability and test coverage.
 
Don't worry about a real database. Feel free to fake it with in-memory data structures.
 
The completed work can be returned to us through a public repository such as GitHub.  Please setup the project so that we can run the application locally in a container via Docker Compose.
